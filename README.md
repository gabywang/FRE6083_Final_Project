# Evaluate the impact of earning report on stock price

You are required to do class projects in groups of 5 members. You should elect one member of your group to be the team leader. Groups once formed cannot be changed midway through the project. The team lead is responsible to facilitate the planning of the project, and the entire team will plan the project under the guidance of your team leader. Planning involves identifying what should be done (tasks), who should do it (resources), when tasks should be done (time frames) and how tasks are best sequenced (dependencies). 
 
Each team will submit PowerPoint slides and all the project files including source codes and executables tar/zipped to our course Web site one week before the presentation day. The project reports should include the Excel sheet about your research on Russell 1000 stocks for their earnings, a drawing of project design, class declaration and data structures, program outputs and your PowerPoint slides. All the teams are requested to present and demonstrate their projects. Each team can resubmit one time on the presentation day. Your project will be judged by program efficiency, complexity and the success of your presentation.
